SAR images despeckling using deep learning neural networks.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing offers a number of advantages over optical remote sensing.
SAR image acquisition is not limited to daytime. Unlike visible spectrum aerial images, SAR signal does
not require daylight. Additionally, SAR radar signal can penetrate clouds, vegetation and can be used to
provide important information about Earth surface and detect physical properties that are not possible with
optical technology.

However, the main drawback of SAR images is the presence of speckle, a signal dependent granular noise.
It visually degrades the appearance of images and may severely affect analysis and information extraction
from the images. For this reason SAR image speckle reduction, or despeckling, is of crucial importance for 
a number of applications. Most of the earlier despeckling techniques caused various degrees of blurring and 
loss of detail.

More recently, deep learning algorithms have been shown to achieve state-of the art performance in a variety
of computer vision tasks, including image denoising. Sever studies have shown that deep learning can be 
successfully used in SAR image despeckling and it outperforms earlier despeckling techniques.
In this project, I am planning to attempt SAR image despeckling with Stable Diffusion.
To the best of my knowledge, such a study has not yet been applied to SAR image despeckling.
